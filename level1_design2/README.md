# sequence detector Design Verification
The verification environment is setup using [Vyoma's UpTickPro](https://vyomasystems.com) provided for the hackathon.

## Verification Environment
The [CoCoTb](https://www.cocotb.org/) based Python test is developed as explained. The test drives inputs to the Design Under Test (adder module here) which takes in 4-bit inputs *a* and *b* and gives 5-bit output *sum*

The values are assigned to the input port using 
```
dut.a.value = 7
dut.b.value = 5
```

The assert statement is used for comparing the adder's outut to the expected value.

The following error is seen:
```
assert dut.sum.value == A+B, "Adder result is incorrect: {A} + {B} != {SUM}, expected value={EXP}".format(
                     AssertionError: Adder result is incorrect: 7 + 5 != 2, expected value=12
```
## Test Scenario **(Important)**
- Test Inputs: a=7 b=5
- Expected Output: sum=12
- Observed Output in the DUT dut.sum=2

Output mismatches for the above inputs proving that there is a design bug

## Design Bug
Based on the above test input and analysing the design, we see the following

```
 always @(a or b) 
  begin
    sum = a - b;             ====> BUG
  end
```
For the adder design, the logic should be ``a + b`` instead of ``a - b`` as in the design code.

## Design Fix
Updating the design and re-running the test makes the test pass.

The updated design is checked in as adder_fix.v

## Verification Strategy

## Is the verification complete ?
